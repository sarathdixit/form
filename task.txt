Task 1 Frontend: (2 Hours)
Develop a stepper UI using Frameworks such as Material UI. 

On the first screen, you are expected to get basic user inputs such as First Name, Last Name, Phone, and Email and properly validate them. Enter the inputs from excel file upload and use redux to store data.


On the second screen, you are expected to use GoogleMaps/ OpenMaps API to auto-complete the address field as and when the user keys in the address box. Mandatory fields include Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Country, and Pincode
On the third screen, youâ€™ll need to summarize the details entered by the user and submit the response by making a POST request to 
https://webhook.site/96546619-8cc2-483a-964b-221d26211c52
Users should also be able to navigate to step1 instead of submitting. All the values should be retained properly.
